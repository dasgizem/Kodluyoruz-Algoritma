[22,27,16,2,18,6]  Insertion Sort Steps

1)[22,27,16,2,18,6]        
2)[16,22,27,2,18,6] 
3)[2,16,22,27,18,6]  
4)[2,16,18,22,27,6]  
5)[2,6,16,18,22,27]  

Big O notation  The number of processes decreasing one by one each time.
n + n-1 + n-2+ n-3 …. = n.(n+1) / 2 =  O(n2)
In this case time complexity of 18 number would be average case because it is neither in the end nor in the beginning.

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]   Selection Sort First 4 steps
In this type of sort we should compare first number with other elements of the list end put the smallest number to the beginning.
1) [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]  
2) [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]  
3) [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]  
4) [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
